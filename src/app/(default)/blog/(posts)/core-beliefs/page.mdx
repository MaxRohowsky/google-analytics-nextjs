# My Core Beliefs


Below, you’ll find my attempt to clarify and structure my core beliefs. This post might be subject to future revision.

## **Set Goals**
A boat that sets sail without a destination drifts in the direction of the wind. Similar to a boat, our lives are affected by external forces that push us in different directions. Often, these forces are devious because they like to hide:

- Parents telling you to do X although you prefer Y
- A raise at work to retain you in a certain position
- A person telling you that something can’t be done

In the absence of goals, these forces heavily determine our live’s destination (i.e., where we end up) and journey (i.e., how we get there). Setting goals allows us to take more control over where we go and how we get there. I believe life is better if we decide on the where and how ourselves. So don’t drift in the direction the wind takes you – set goals instead!

**Accountability**. If you commit to doing something, do it and take responsibility. Honor the things you promise (to others and yourself) with actions.

**Humility**. On a personal level, humility entails knowing yourself and owning your flaws. Interpersonally, it means understanding that you’re not worth more than others. A humble personality brings numerous benefits: you’re more likeable, empathetic, approachable, attractive, and trust-worthy.

On the other side, people who are arrogant and narcissistic are unpleasant and often live unhappy lives. So, in the words of Kendrick Lamar, “Bitch, be humble“!

**Show, don’t tell**. Your past actions strongly reflect who you are. They manifest your choices and, therefore, paint a richer picture of you than the words you say.

An Olympic medalist doesn’t need to proclaim their athleticism, just as a Nobel laureate doesn’t need to declare their intellectual prowess. These achievements speak volumes about the dedication and perseverance required over an extended period.

It’s true: actions are louder than words. So, when demonstrating ability, skill, or excellence, show, don’t tell.

**Keep It Simple**. It’s not easy to distill things down to their core and explain them in a simple manner. Often, you’ll 
find that people who explain things in a bloated and complicated way, don’t have a solid understanding themselves.[^1]

What matters in communication, is what the receiving end understands. And we’re more likely to get our message across if we keep it simple.1

**Move Fast, Do Hard Stuff, and Stick With It**. Many of us fail because we don’t push through on hard stuff for a prolonged period of time. This includes getting in shape, switching careers, building an audience, learning a language, finding a life partner, stopping to smoke, and so on.

Moreover, it doesn’t help that our brains are wired to romanticize the idea of quick and easy successes. In fact, this inclination has fueled industries around get rich quick schemes, weight loss pills, lottery tickets, and gambling for decades. However, a life worth living involves moving fast, doing hard stuff, and sticking with it.

*Move Fast*. The obvious benefit of moving fast is that you’ll do more per unit time. The less obvious benefit is that the cost of doing something will seem lower. The opposite is also true: If every job application takes you 6 months to write, you’ll probably hesitate to write the next because it will feel too expensive.[^2]

*Do Hard Stuff*. Doing hard stuff is rewarding. You’ll grow as a person, stand out from the crowd, and be appreciated for your work.

*Stick With It*. We give up because it’s easy to fall back on old habits and comforts. But the unpleasant truth is that most great things take a lot of hard work over a long period of time.

**Friends, Family, and Health come First.** Although last on this list, we can not neglect what’s most important in life. We get many shots at building careers, progressing projects, and winning deals but some facets of live are more brittle. The relationship you have to the people most important in your life, and your health (mental & physical) top this list.
