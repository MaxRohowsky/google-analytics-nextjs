# CSS Display vs CSS Position

The CSS properties display and position cause a lot of headache. The issue is that they work in tandem as both properties influence where elements are located on a screen. In addition, HTML elements can have different display values by default making things more complicated. In this post, I’ll untangle the two CSS properties as best as I can.

## CSS Position Property
The position property belongs to a module from the CSS specification called “CSS positioned layout“. 
The modules in the specification attempt to bundle related topics in the otherwise messy CSS world. 
The aforementioned module covers things like top, right, bottom, left, z-index, position, and a few others. 
Below, we’ll take a close look at the position property.

The position property decides where on the screen your element is shown. 
It can take one of the following values: static, relative, fixed, absolute or sticky.

- ``static``: This is the default position value for all elements.
They are not affected by top, bottom, left, and right properties.

<div className='static border my-4 rounded-sm p-2'>This is a div with position: static.</div>

- ``relative``: Positions elements relative to their normal (i.e. static) position.
Contrary to static, the top, bottom, left, and right properties do have an influence.
This is a div with position: relative.



- ``fixed``: The positioning happens relative to the viewport, so the element stays in the same place even if you scroll (see the element in the bottom right corner).
This is a div with position: fixed.

- ``absolute``: Takes an element out of the normal document flow and position it relative to its nearest positioned ancestor.
If there are no positioned ancestors, the positioning is relative to the document body.
This is a div with position: absolute.
This is a div with position: relative


```javascript
const position = 'absolute';

```

sticky: Changes between relative and fixed depending on the scroll position.
Internet explorer doesn’t support this position and safari requires a the “webkit” prefix.
Be aware that position: sticky only works if at least one of the following is defined: top, bottom, left, or right.
Scroll down to see how position:sticky influences the element!

This is a div with position: sticky.
Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Sed euismod, nunc nec varius cursus, nunc erat condimentum dolor, id iaculis leo purus non enim. In hac habitasse platea dictumst. Donec mollis nulla id neque varius, vel tempor mauris pretium. Id iaculis leo purus non enim. In hac habitasse platea dictumst. Donec mollis nulla id neque varius, vel tempor mauris pretium.

Note: You might have heard about the z-index. It allows us to influence how positioned elements are stacked. It’s important to note that it only works on ‘positioned’ elements, so elements that have a position value other than static.

So what have we learned so far? The position property positions elements. Most importantly, it allows us to take things out of the document flow (position: absolute) or move things relative to their ‘normal’ position within the document flow (position: relative).

CSS Display Property
The display property is defined in the CSS display module of the the CSS specifications. It controls the CSS formatting box tree that is generated from the document element tree.

Let’s dive deeper. CSS takes a source document organized as a tree of elements and text nodes (typically the Document Object Model) and renders it to the screen. Before the render, an intermediary structure is generated, the formatting box tree, which defines the formatting structure of the rendered document.

Each box in the box tree represents its corresponding element (or pseudo-element) rendered on the screen (more on that here). What’s important is that the generation and control of these boxes is specified by the element’s display property. Usually, one box is generated, the principal box, but some display values (e.g. list-item) generate more.

More specifically, the display property controls the principal box by defining the inner and outer display type.

Outer display type. This specifies how the principal box participates in the flow of the document.

block: Element starts on a new line, and takes up the whole width (e.g. `<p>`)
inline: The name ‘inline’ is derived from ‘within a line’ (e.g. `<span>`).
Height and width have no effect
Often used to style text ‘within a line’ of text
They do not start on a new line
run-in: Mixture of inline and block. Best avoid these.
Inner display type. This specifies how the child elements of the box are laid out. There are quite a few but the most common ones are: flex, grid, and table. I’ll spare the details of these for another post because there’s too much to cover.

To this point, we’ve seen that the display property controls the boxes. It’s also worth mentioning that it also controls the generation and visibility of the boxes. Here are some more important display properties:

hidden: Any boxes generated by the element are invisible but take up space in the document object model.
none: The element and its descendants generate no boxes or text sequences.
