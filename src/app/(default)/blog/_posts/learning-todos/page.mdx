There’s a lot of stuff on my learning ‘bucket-list’ that I haven’t had the time to look at yet. 
In this post, I want to dump all that stuff into one place along with some valuable learning material.
 There’s no order or structure to the list below – very unlike me, I know. But it’s nice to have it all in one place. 
 So here goes:

Type safety in TypeScript. I get the gist but how do I ‘type’ properly without scattering any everywhere.
How to properly handle layout with the CSS properties display and position.
What are closures in JavaScript?
Understand the difference between assignment and mutation in JavaScript. To do that, I should read ‘The const Deception‘ by Josh Comeau.
Why is the NextJS \<Image> component better than just using \<img>? Should be a quick one as it’s in the docs.
How to properly handle tax on selling digital products in Germany. Specifically, I need to understand how I’m liable for remitting tax on sales form foreign countries.
How does the point above influence the decision between Stripe and Lemon Squeezy?
For the web app I’m currently building I need to mercilessly master NextJS and TypeScript. This will be quite painful.
I’m happy with my progress with NextJS so far but I still don’t get stuff like middleware and session management. I’ll need all that stuff for the current project.
I’m also using Supabase and TypeScript for this web app but I think I can ‘wing it’ and get away with wishy washy knowledge in that area.
I remember hearing that using fetch is better than stuff like axios in NextJS apps. Is that true? If yes, why? Here’s the first Google result that I should read.
Refresh my understanding of JavaScript’s event loop (here’s a good start).
For Python and JavaScript I feel like there are still quite a few loose ends that I need to tie up.
Alright, that’s all I can think of at the moment. There’s probably more but I need to pack my bags because I’m leaving to visit my dad in Poland tomorrow.
