            <h2>1. Data Protection at a Glance</h2>

            <h3>General Information</h3>
            <p>The following notes provide a simple overview of what happens to your personal data when you visit our website. Personal data is all data with which you can be personally identified. Detailed information on the subject of data protection can be found in our privacy policy listed below this text.</p>

            <h3>Who is responsible for data collection on this website?</h3>
            <p>The data processing on this website is carried out by the website operator. You can find their contact details in the imprint of this website.</p>

            <h3>How do we collect your data?</h3>
            <p>Your data is collected firstly by you providing it to us. This can be data that you enter in a contact form, for example.</p>
            <p>Other data is automatically collected by our IT systems when you visit the website. These are mainly technical data (e.g., internet browser, operating system, or time of the page view). The collection of this data occurs automatically as soon as you enter our website.</p>

            <h3>What do we use your data for?</h3>
            <p>Part of the data is collected to ensure error-free provision of the website. Other data can be used to analyze your user behavior.</p>

            <h3>What rights do you have regarding your data?</h3>
            <p>You have the right at any time to obtain information free of charge about the origin, recipient, and purpose of your stored personal data. You also have the right to request the correction, blocking, or deletion of this data. For this purpose, as well as for further questions on the subject of data protection, you can contact us at any time at the address given in the imprint. Furthermore, you have the right to lodge a complaint with the competent supervisory authority.</p>
            <p>In addition, you have the right to request the restriction of processing of your personal data under certain circumstances. Details can be found in the privacy policy under "Right to restriction of processing".</p>


            <h2>2. General Information and Mandatory Information</h2>

            <h3>Data Protection</h3>
            <p>The operators of these pages take the protection of your personal data very seriously. We treat your personal data confidentially and in accordance with the statutory data protection regulations and this privacy policy.</p>
            <p>When you use this website, various personal data are collected. Personal data is data with which you can be personally identified. This privacy policy explains what data we collect and what we use it for. It also explains how and for what purpose this happens.</p>
            <p>We would like to point out that data transmission over the Internet (e.g. communication by email) can have security gaps. A complete protection of data against access by third parties is not possible.</p>

            <h3>Note to the responsible entity</h3>
            <p>The responsible entity for data processing on this website can be found in the imprint.</p>
            <p>The responsible entity is the natural or legal person who alone or jointly with others decides on the purposes and means of processing personal data (e.g. names, email addresses, etc.).</p>

            <h3>Revocation of your consent to data processing</h3>
            <p>Many data processing operations are only possible with your express consent. You can revoke consent you have already given at any time. An informal email making this request is sufficient. The legality of the data processing carried out before the revocation remains unaffected by the revocation.</p>

            <h3>Right to object to data collection in special cases and to direct advertising (Art. 21 GDPR)</h3>
            <p>If data processing is carried out on the basis of Art. 6 para. 1 lit. e or f GDPR, you have the right at any time to object to the processing of your personal data for reasons arising from your particular situation; this also applies to profiling based on these provisions. The respective legal basis on which processing is based can be found in this privacy policy. If you object, we will no longer process your affected personal data unless we can demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for the processing which override your interests, rights and freedoms, or the processing is for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims (objection according to Art. 21 Para. 1 GDPR).</p>
            <p>If your personal data is processed to conduct direct advertising, you have the right to object at any time to the processing of personal data concerning you for the purpose of such advertising; this also applies to profiling insofar as it is associated with such direct advertising. If you object, your personal data will subsequently no longer be used for the purpose of direct advertising (objection according to Art. 21 Para. 2 GDPR).</p>

            <h3>Right to file complaints with regulatory authorities</h3>
            <p>In the case of breaches of the GDPR, the persons affected have a right of appeal to a regulatory authority, in particular in the member state of their habitual residence, place of work or place of the alleged infringement. The right to appeal is without prejudice to other administrative or judicial remedies.</p>

            <h3>Right to data portability</h3>
            <p>You have the right to have data which we process based on your consent or in fulfillment of a contract automatically delivered to yourself or to a third party in a standard, machine-readable format. If you require the direct transfer of data to another responsible party, this will only be done to the extent technically feasible.</p>

            <h3>SSL or TLS encryption</h3>
            <p>This site uses SSL or TLS encryption for security reasons and to protect the transmission of confidential content, such as orders or inquiries you send to us as the site operator. You can recognize an encrypted connection by the fact that the address line of the browser changes from "http://" to "https://" and by the lock symbol in your browser line.</p>

            <p>If SSL or TLS encryption is activated, the data you transmit to us cannot be read by third parties.</p>

            <h3>Information, blocking, deletion and correction</h3>
            <p>Within the framework of the applicable legal provisions, you have the right at any time to free information about your stored personal data, its origin and recipient and the purpose of the data processing and, if necessary, a right to correct, block or delete this data. For further information on personal data, you can contact us at any time at the address given in the imprint.</p>

            <h3>Right to restrict processing</h3>
            <p>You have the right to request the restriction of the processing of your personal data. For this purpose, you can contact us at any time at the address given in the imprint. The right to restrict processing exists in the following cases:</p>
            <p>If you dispute the accuracy of your personal data stored by us, we usually need time to verify this. For the duration of the review, you have the right to request the restriction of the processing of your personal data.</p>
            <p>If the processing of your personal data was/is carried out unlawfully, you can request the restriction of data processing instead of deletion.</p>
            <p>If we no longer need your personal data, but you need it to exercise, defend or assert legal claims, you have the right to request the restriction of the processing of your personal data instead of deletion.</p>
            <p>If you have lodged an objection pursuant to Art. 21 Para. 1 GDPR, a balance must be struck between your interests and ours. As long as it has not yet been determined whose interests prevail, you have the right to request the restriction of the processing of your personal data.</p>
            <p>If you have restricted the processing of your personal data, these data - apart from their storage - may only be processed with your consent or for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims or for the protection of the rights of another natural or legal person or for reasons of important public interest of the European Union or a member state.</p>



            <h2>3. Data Collection on Our Website</h2>

            <h3>Cookies</h3>

            <p>Our website uses cookies to some extent. Cookies do not cause any damage to your computer and do not contain viruses. Cookies are used to make our offer more user-friendly, effective, and secure. Cookies are small text files that are stored on your computer and saved by your browser.</p>
            <p>Most of the cookies we use are so-called "session cookies." They are automatically deleted after your visit. Other cookies remain stored on your device until you delete them. These cookies allow us to recognize your browser on your next visit.</p>
            <p>You can configure your browser to inform you about the setting of cookies and allow cookies only in individual cases, exclude the acceptance of cookies for certain cases or in general, and activate the automatic deletion of cookies when closing the browser. Disabling cookies may limit the functionality of this website.</p>
            <p>Cookies that are necessary to carry out the electronic communication process or to provide certain functions you desire (e.g., shopping cart function) are stored on the basis of Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR. The website operator has a legitimate interest in storing cookies for the technically error-free and optimized provision of its services. As far as other cookies (e.g., cookies for analyzing your surfing behavior) are stored, they are treated separately in this privacy policy.</p>

            <h3>Server Log Files</h3>
            <p>The provider of the pages automatically collects and stores information in so-called server log files, which your browser automatically transmits to us. These are:</p>
            <p>Browser type and browser version<br />
                Operating system used<br />
                Referrer URL<br />
                Hostname of the accessing computer<br />
                Time of the server request<br />
                IP address</p>
            <p>No merging of this data with other data sources is carried out.</p>
            <p>The collection of this data is based on Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR. The website operator has a legitimate interest in the technically error-free presentation and optimization of its website - for this purpose, the server log files must be recorded.</p>

            <h3>Request by Email, Telephone, or Fax</h3>
            <p>If you contact us by email, telephone, or fax, your request, including all resulting personal data (name, request), will be stored and processed by us for the purpose of processing your request. We do not pass on this data without your consent.</p>
            <p>The processing of this data is based on Art. 6 para. 1 lit. b GDPR if your request is related to the fulfillment of a contract or is necessary for the implementation of pre-contractual measures. In all other cases, the processing is based on your consent (Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a GDPR) and/or on our legitimate interests (Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR), as we have a legitimate interest in the effective processing of requests addressed to us.</p>
            <p>The data sent by you to us via contact requests remains with us until you request us to delete it, revoke your consent to the storage, or the purpose for the data storage lapses (e.g., after completion of your request). Mandatory statutory provisions - in particular statutory retention periods - remain unaffected.</p>



            <h3>Embedded YouTube-Videos</h3>

            <p>On some of our web pages, we embed Youtube videos. The operator of the corresponding plugins is YouTube, LLC, 901 Cherry Ave., San Bruno, CA 94066, USA. When you visit a page with the YouTube plugin, a connection to Youtube servers is established. This informs Youtube about which pages you visit. If you are logged into your Youtube account, Youtube can associate your browsing behavior with you personally. You can prevent this by logging out of your Youtube account beforehand.</p>

            <p>When a Youtube video is started, the provider uses cookies that collect information about user behavior.</p>

            <p>Those who have disabled the storage of cookies for the Google Ad program will not have to expect such cookies when watching Youtube videos. However, Youtube also stores non-personal usage information in other cookies. If you want to prevent this, you must block the storage of cookies in the browser.</p>

            <p>For more information on data protection at "Youtube", please see the provider's privacy policy at: https://www.google.de/intl/de/policies/privacy/</p>

            <h3>Google Analytics</h3>

            <p>We use Google Analytics on our website, a web analysis service of Google Inc. ("Google"), 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA.</p>

            <p>Google Analytics uses so-called "cookies", text files that are stored on your device and that enable an analysis of your use of the websites you visit. Google Analytics can also use so-called web beacons (invisible graphics). These web beacons can evaluate information such as visitor traffic on websites. The information generated by cookies and web beacons about the use of our website (including the IP address of users) is transmitted to a Google server, possibly in the USA or other third countries, and stored there. This information can be passed on by Google to Google's contractual partners.</p>

            <p>Information on the standard contractual clauses and the transfer to the USA from us to Google and other relevant data on data processing by Google in the context of using Google services can be found in this privacy policy under the section "5) Information on Google services".</p>

            <p>The following types of data are processed by Google:</p>

            <p>Online identifiers (including cookie identifiers)
                IP address
                Device identifiers
                Furthermore, you can find more detailed information on the processed information at https://www.google.com/intl/de/policies/privacy/#infocollect under "Data we collect as you use our services", and at https://privacy.google.com/businesses/adsservices/.</p>

            <p>As part of the consent given to use Google Analytics, the following data is also processed by us:</p>

            <p>Your IP address
                Date and time of submission
                We only use Google Analytics with activated IP anonymization ("anonymize IP"). This means that your IP address is shortened by Google within member states of the European Union or in other contracting states of the Agreement on the European Economic Area. Only in exceptional cases is the full IP address transmitted to a Google server in the USA and shortened there.</p>

            <p>Furthermore, we have concluded a contract with Google for order processing (Art. 28 GDPR). Google processes the data on our behalf to evaluate your use of the website, to compile reports on website activities for us, and to provide other services related to website and internet use to us. Google may transfer this information to third parties if required by law or if third parties process this data on behalf of Google.</p>

            <p>The purpose of integrating Google Analytics is to analyze user behavior on our website and to be able to respond to it. This allows us to continuously improve our offer.</p>

            <p>The purpose of processing the data collected in the course of the declaration of consent is to log your consent.</p>

            <p>The legal basis for the processing of personal data described here within the scope of the measurement procedure is an expressly given consent according to Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. a) GDPR.</p>

            <p>The legal basis for processing the data that is processed in the course of obtaining consent is our legitimate interest according to Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. f) GDPR. We have a legitimate interest in being able to prove the consent you have given to the measurement procedure (Art. 7 Para. 1 GDPR).</p>

            <p>As part of the order processing, Google is entitled to commission subcontractors. You can find a list of these subcontractors at https://privacy.google.com/businesses/subprocessors/.</p>
