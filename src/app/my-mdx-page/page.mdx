Having worked extensively with APIs, I’ve stumbled upon the term cURL quite frequently. However, I never took the time to understand what it is. This post aims to change that.

To understand what cURL is, let’s start with what a URL is. A URL (Uniform Resource Locator) is the address of a resource on the internet. 
Browsers use them to retrieve HTML pages, CSS documents, JavaScript files, images, and other resources from web servers. The image below shows that a URL is made of different parts.

Let’s consider the 3 most important parts in more detail:

Scheme: Indicates the protocol (method used to transfer data around a network) that the browser must use to request the resource. 
The two most common protocols are HTTP and HTTPS but the browser also understands others such as mailto (see here for an extensive list).
Host (aka. Authority): The two terms are often used interchangeably, but strictly speaking, the authority also includes the port (standardised as 80 for HTTP and 443 for HTTPS). 
For example, the authority “www.example.com:443” has the host “www.example.com”. Usually, the port is omitted if the web server uses the standards.
Path: It specifies the path to the resource on the web server and functions similarly to the path you use in your file explorer.
Now, let’s move to cURLs. A cURL (client Uniform Resource Locator) is a command line tool used to transfer data to and from a web 
server using the URL syntax. The cURL command is provided by the libcURL library which supports different transfer protocols (e.g., HTTPS, SMTP, FTP). 
When making a request using cURL, you can do things like set proxies, add authentication, include cookies.

The basic syntax of a curl command that can be used in a terminal looks like this:

cURL [options] [URL]
And here are the most common options:

-X, --request : Specifies HTTP method to be used for the request, such as GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.
-d, --data : Sends data in a POST request (often used to send form data or JSON payloads)
-H, --header : Add custom HTTP header to request (useful for setting Content-Type or Auth.)
-o, --output : Writes the output to a file.
-v, --verbose: Provides verbose output, showing detailed information. It’s useful for debugging and understanding the network interactions.
Finally, here’s an example of a POST request that sends a JSON string:


```bash
cURL -X POST -d '{"name": "cURL", "type": "article"}' https://www.example.com/posts
```

```javascript
const fetch = require('node-fetch');
```
