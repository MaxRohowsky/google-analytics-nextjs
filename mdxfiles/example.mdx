# CSS Display vs CSS Position

The CSS properties display and position cause a lot of headache. The issue is that they work in tandem as both properties influence where elements are located on a screen. In addition, HTML elements can have different display values by default making things more complicated. In this post, I’ll untangle the two CSS properties as best as I can.

## CSS Position Property
The position property belongs to a module from the CSS specification called “CSS positioned layout“. 
The modules in the specification attempt to bundle related topics in the otherwise messy CSS world. 
The aforementioned module covers things like top, right, bottom, left, z-index, position, and a few others. 
Below, we’ll take a close look at the position property.

The position property decides where on the screen your element is shown. 
It can take one of the following values: static, relative, fixed, absolute or sticky.

- ``static``: This is the default position value for all elements.
They are not affected by top, bottom, left, and right properties.
